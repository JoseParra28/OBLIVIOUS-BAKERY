## User Experience (UX)
I wanted to keep the design quite simple on this site so as to not distract the user. I used the main linear gradient colour throughout the site to establish a brand with oblivious. The off-white colour I used for my background look and the 
dark-gray for my font color was used to keep it simple but appealing.

### Colour Scheme

| HEX            | Placemnet.    |
| -------------  | ------------- |
| `#f5f5f5`      |Backgound color|
| `#424040`      | Font color    |
|     Linear-gradient colors     |
|                |               
| `#782b25`      | Falu red
| `#a23930`      | Auburn
| `#872b20`      | Burnt umber
| `#d9402f`      | Chilli red
| `#61111f`      | Chocolate cosmos
| `#6a1818`      | Rosewood

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) to generate my colour palette.

<img src="food/static/images/readme-img/color-pallet.jpg" alt="color-pallete">

I've used CSS :root variables to easily update the global colour scheme by changing only one value, instead of everywhere in the CSS file.
I have also set the values of h1, h2, h3, p, and button values at the beginning of the main css page to avoid rewriting them.
I created 4 css files to keep the code more organised. These being MAIN, COLORS, MENU, FORMS.css.

## Typography

- Lato
- Sans-serif

## Images

### Logo

Site's logo was created by myself using photoshop.

# Database Design
I created an entity relationship diagram using Diagrams.net. This helped me to visualize the relationships between my data structures and made the development process easier as I had everything mapped out in front of me for reference to avoid having to reference each models.py file individually.

## Models

   - Cake
   - Donut

# Agile development

## GitHub Projects
GitHub Projects served as an Agile tool for this project. It isn't a specialized tool, but with the right tags and project creation/issue assignments, it was made to work.

Through it, user stories were used to map out the development progress of the project using the basic Kanban board. It helped me to see the backlog of work I needed to complete and move tasks across as I worked on them before testing and signing off to finish them.

## GitHub issues
GitHub Issues served as an another Agile tool. There, I used my own User Story Template to manage user stories

# Testing

<details>
<summary>HTML</summary>
I have used the recommended HTML W3C Validator to validate all of my HTML files.

As my project uses Jinja syntax, such as {% for loops %}, {% url 'home' %}, and {{ variable|filter }} it will not validate properly if I copy and paste into the HTML validator straight from my source files.

Usually in order to properly validate these types of files, it's recommended to validate by uri from the deployed Heroku pages.

Unfortunately, nearly all of the pages on this site require a user to be logged-in and authenticated, and will not work using this method, due to the fact that the HTML Validator (W3C) doesn't have access to login to the pages.

In order to properly validate my HTML pages with Jinja syntax for authenticated pages, I followed these steps:

- Navigate to the deployed pages which require authentication
- Right-click anywhere on the page, and select View Page Source (usually CTRL+U or âŒ˜+U on Mac).
- This will display the entire "compiled" code, without any Jinja syntax.
- Copy everything, and use the validate by input method.
- Repeat this process for every page that requires a user to be logged-in/authenticated.

# Deploiment

[Heroku live deploiment](https://oblivious-bakery.herokuapp.com/)

## ElephantSQL Database

### This project uses [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for the PostgreSQL Database.

To obtain your own Postgres Database, sign-up with your GitHub account, then follow these steps:

- Click Create New Instance to start a new database.
- Provide a name (this is commonly the name of the project: tribe).
- Select the Tiny Turtle (Free) plan.
- You can leave the Tags blank.
- Select the Region and Data Center closest to you.
- Once created, click on the new database name, where you can view the database URL and Password.

## Cloudinary API

### This project uses the Cloudinary API to store media assets online, due to the fact that Heroku doesn't persist this type of data.

To obtain your own [Cloudinary API](https://cloudinary.com/) key, create an account and log in.

- For Primary interest, you can choose Programmable Media for image and video API.
- Optional: edit your assigned cloud name to something more memorable.
- On your Cloudinary Dashboard, you can copy your API Environment Variable.
- Be sure to remove the CLOUDINARY_URL= as part of the API value; this is the key.

## Heroku Deployment
This project uses [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select New in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select Create new app from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select Create App.
- From the new app Settings, click Reveal Config Vars, and set your environment variables.
- Key	Value
   - CLOUDINARY_URL	insert your own Cloudinary API key here
   - DATABASE_URL	insert your own ElephantSQL database URL here
   - DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC	1 (this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment)
   - SECRET_KEY	this can be any random secret key

## Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly, and in my case I needed to create runtime.txt and install an compatible vertion of Python.

   - requirements.txt
   - Procfile
   - runtime.txt

You can install this project's requirements (where applicable) using:

   - pip3 install -r requirements.txt
If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

   - pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
The Procfile can be created with the following command:

   - echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile
   - replace app_name with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located
For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:

   - Select Automatic Deployment from the Heroku app.
Or:

   - In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: heroku login -i
   - Set the remote for Heroku: heroku git:remote -a app_name (replace app_name with your app name)
   - After performing the standard Git add, commit, and push to GitHub, you can now type:
      - git push heroku main
The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!   


# Customized deployment 
I have follow the steps as above to deploy my app however, I did run with a couple of issues while doing so. 
I contacted tutor assistant and recived much appreciated support from one of the tutors. All i needed was to update some vertion of my installed files. After doing this, the app was up and running.

- Reference Material
Used Django decumentation to help me through the building of this site, as well as Stack overflow to help me solve some small errors and issues i came across
