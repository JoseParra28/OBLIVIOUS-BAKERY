## User Experience (UX)
I wanted to keep the design quite simple on this site so as to not distract the user. I used the main linear gradient colour throughout the site to establish a brand with oblivious. The off-white colour I used for my background look and the 
dark-gray for my font color was used to keep it simple but appealing.

### Colour Scheme

| HEX            | Placemnet.    |
| -------------  | ------------- |
| `#f5f5f5`      |Backgound color|
| `#424040`      | Font color    |
|     Linear-gradient colors     |
|                |               
| `#782b25`      | Falu red
| `#a23930`      | Auburn
| `#872b20`      | Burnt umber
| `#d9402f`      | Chilli red
| `#61111f`      | Chocolate cosmos
| `#6a1818`      | Rosewood

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) to generate my colour palette.

I've used CSS :root variables to easily update the global colour scheme by changing only one value, instead of everywhere in the CSS file.
I have also set the values of h1, h2, h3, p, and button values at the beginning of the main css page to avoid rewriting them.
I created 4 css files to keep the code more organised. These being MAIN, COLORS, MENU, FORMS.css.

I have used [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/ip/gr-sea-gg-brand-home-base?utm_source=google&utm_medium=search&utm_campaign=goog_selfserve_brand_wk22_replicate_core_branded_keyword&utm_term=1329&campaignid=17601148700&adgroupid=141182782954&keyword=cloudinary&device=c&matchtype=e&adposition=&gclid=CjwKCAjwue6hBhBVEiwA9YTx8P-hLvbb_KcqF4Bpd047hJ-hJhBm6HgQxVqJVLussoHWF4oyXnSv8BoCFpYQAvD_BwE) to add custom images to the each item.

# Database Design
I created an entity relationship diagram using Diagrams.net.
